/*
 * Core Capture Services
 * OpenText Core Capture Services are a set of RESTful web service interfaces that provides capture functionality. Being developed in a purely RESTful style, Core Capture Services are easier to consume for the purposes of writing custom clients.  Core Capture Services identifies resources by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). It defines specific media types to represent resources and drives application state transfers by using link relations. It uses a limited number of HTTP standard methods (GET, POST, and DELETE) to manipulate these resources over the HTTP protocol.  Core Capture Services (hereafter simply called, \"service\") supports only the JSON format for resource representation. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data interchange format based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language standard.
